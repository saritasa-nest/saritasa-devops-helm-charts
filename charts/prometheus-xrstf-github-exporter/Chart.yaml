  A Helm chart for Kubernetes to a github stats exporter for Prometheus.

  You will need to create the secret containing Github token first:
  The token must have permissions to:
  "Read access to code, issues, metadata, and pull requests, actions"
  in all the repositories to be scrapped
  ```sh
  kubectl -n prometheus create secret generic github-token \
    --from-literal=token=YOUR_TOKEN

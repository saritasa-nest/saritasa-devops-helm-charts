  A Helm chart for Tekton Pipelines

  Implements:
  - common tekton tasks
  - common tekton pipelines
  - common tekton trigger templates
  - common tekton trigger bindings

  Implemented pipelines include:
  - buildpack based pipelines based on generator template (php, python, frontend, nodejs, ruby, go)
  - kaniko pipeline
  - wordpress pipeline

  ## `example usage with argocd`

  Install the chart:

  ```
  helm repo add saritasa https://saritasa-nest.github.io/saritasa-devops-helm-charts/
  ```

  then if you want to support only frontend and django pipelines based on buildpack without any script modifications:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Application
  metadata:
    name: tekton-pipelines
    namespace: argo-cd
    finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
    annotations:
      argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
      argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "60"
  spec:
    destination:
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
      namespace: ci
    project: default
    source:
      chart: saritasa-tekton-pipelines
      helm:
        values: |
          buildpacks:
            enabled: true
            generate:
              buildpackFrontendBuildPipeline:
                enabled: true

              buildpackDjangoBuildPipeline:
                enabled: true

      repoURL: https://saritasa-nest.github.io/saritasa-devops-helm-charts/
      targetRevision: "0.1.4"
    syncPolicy:
      automated:
        prune: true
        selfHeal: true
      syncOptions:
        - CreateNamespace=true
  ```

  If you want to modify the behavior of the build step you can easily do that by redefining steps you want to run prior to running the `build` step
  of the associated buildpack pipeline. You can create multiple versions of pipelines as a result. Just make sure to give them a different name

  an example:

  ```yaml
  buildpacks:
    enabled: true
    generate:
      buildpackFrontendBuildPipelineNew:
        name: buildpack-frontend-build-pipeline-new
        enabled: false
        buildTaskName: buildpack-frontend-new
        buildTaskSteps:
          - name: hello1
            image: node:14
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            workingDir: $(resources.inputs.app.path)
            script: |
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "hello world1"

          - name: hello2
            image: node:15
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            workingDir: $(resources.inputs.app.path)
            script: |
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "hello world2"
  ```

  Chart that installs our solution to send heartbeat pings via OpsGenie API automatically

  You will need to create the secret containing opsgenie APIKEY first:

  ```sh
  kubectl -n opsgenie create secret generic opsgenie-apikey-secret \
    --from-literal=apikey=YOUR_APIKEY
  ```

  Keep in mind that the name of your heartbeat in opsgenie should be the exact name of your kubernetes cluster
